# Transcriptional Profile of Mammalian Cardiac Regeneration with mRNA-Seq
This analysis is based on the data published in this study: *Oâ€™Meara et al.

Regeneration. Circ Res. Feb 2015. PMID: 25477501*
We will also be deviating from the published methods in favor of using more
up-to-date strategies and tools. However, the workflow you will develop should
still capture and recreate the same core biological signals observed in the
original work.
